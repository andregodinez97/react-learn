Notes:

### Building content with JSX

- A component is a Function or Class

  - that produces HTML to show to the User (JSX)
  - Handles feedback from the user (Using Event Handlers)

- Can't insert object to reference inside jsx
  - exceptions for style

- HTML vs JSX
    - class - className
    - for - htmlFor

## Communicating with Props

### Three Tenets of Components
- Component Nesting
    - Component can be shown inside of another
- Component Reusability
    - Easily reused through out the application
- Component Configuration
    - Configure component when it is created
